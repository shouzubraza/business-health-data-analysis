# Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling Project

This repository contains the R scripts, data analysis, and final report for a comprehensive statistical analysis and data mining project. The objective is to perform descriptive analytics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling on two datasets: **Cybercost.csv** and **Hypertension-risk-model-main.csv**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

### 1. **Cybercost.csv**
**Columns:**
- `Csecurity` â€“ Number of cybersecurity personnel
- `Attacks` â€“ Monthly cyberattacks
- `Databases` â€“ Number of databases
- `Priv Users` â€“ Number of privileged users
- `Users` â€“ Total number of users
- `Cost P/M` â€“ Monthly cost

**Key Tasks:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Scatter plots, box plots, correlation analysis
- Linear regression to determine cost predictors
- Random sampling & confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing (e.g., small companies overcharged)

---

### 2. **Hypertension-risk-model-main.csv**
**Columns:**
- Demographics: `male` (1=male, 0=female), `age`
- Health indicators: `currentSmoker`, `cigsPerDay`, `BPMeds`, `diabetes`, `totChol`, `sysBP`, `diaBP`, `BMI`, `heartRate`, `glucose`
- Target: `Risk`

**Key Tasks:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Scatter plots, box plots, correlation analysis
- Linear & multiple regression to predict `Risk`
- Select top 3 predictive attributes with justification
- Hypothesis formulation and testing

---

## ðŸ›  Methods & Tools
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `caret`, `lmtest`
- **Statistical Methods:**
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Correlation analysis
  - Linear and multiple regression
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Confidence intervals & sampling

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Outputs
- Statistical summaries of datasets
- Scatter plots & regression lines
- Confidence interval visualizations
- Hypothesis testing tables and plots

---

## ðŸ“„ Final Report
The final report is formatted as a professional statistical paper including:
- Problem statement
- Data preparation & cleaning steps
- Methodology
- Analysis & findings (with visualizations)
- Conclusions & recommendations
